==================================================================

WIDGET IDEAS:


BOTTOM PAGE widget doesn’t work when use to display bottom of all pages.
Just like UNDER POST CONTENT widget, there must be an additional another widget called ABOVE CONTENT widget to display banner ads below the Post Titles.
BEFORE CONTENT and AFTER CONTENT widgets must also be display for all Index Pages i.e. Home Page, Tag Page, Category Page, Search Page, Static Page, Archive Page etc. Currently it’s just display on Post Pages.



APPEARANCE CUSTOMIZE FEATURES IDEAS:

Under customize section (Colors, Fonts, Background), there is no option to change Top Menu Background Color when Hover mouse. See here example: http://pasteboard.co/csiVrLKKO.png
Under customize section (Post Content and Archive Page Design), there is no option to Hide Meta Comment Icon/Counts from Archive Pages and Post Pages, just like other option of Hiding Author and Date.
Under customize section (Colors, Fonts, Background), there is no option to Change Footer Widget Fonts and Size, just like other Sidebar Fonts changing option.
Under customize section, there is no option to Centralized Header Main Menu Text Links to be appear in middle of menu bar.
Under customize section, there is no option to Translate or Change Different Headings and Keywords or Texts of whole theme easily i.e. Read More, Recommended Article etc.
Under customize section, there is no option to Translate or Change Different Headings and Keywords or Texts of whole theme easily i.e. Read More, Recommended Article etc.
Under customize section, Just like Blogger MagOne version, on WordPress there is no option to include Tag/Category headings just before tag/category links appeared at below of articles, and also there is no option to add Share heading/title just before ShareThis sharing links, and also share buttons are not align with FontAwesome Share icons, and moved downside as appearing at below of articles. See here example: http://pasteboard.co/csvj16Ebg.png
Just like Blogger version, on WordPress there is no option of Post Pagination Short Code to be include within articles or widgets. Please include Post Pagination short code. On button Short Codes there is no option to use FontAwesome Icons with Buttons on Post Articles using Short Code.
On WordPress theme there is No Random Post Short Code available on theme, Just like Blogger MagOne version.
BUGS FIXES IDEAS:
There is a serious bug in MagOne WordPress version, under customize section (THEME OPTION), when we change any settings/options from Theme Customize section tab, But those changes doesn’t apply on THEME OPTION section under Customize tab. Under THEME OPTION all settings/options remain default, even after changing same settings/options from Theme Customize section.
Blow Post Titles, Article Excerpt (description) must display “META Description” of a particular article instead of showing Wordpress Post Excerpt description. Because Post Meta Description is more good for Excerpt. And when a user (like me) who don’t use WordPress Post Excerpt while writing articles, the MagOne theme shows Snippet as Excerpt, even after disabling “Don’t show Snippet as Excerpt” option under CUSTOMIZE section (Post Content).
As appearing Below Post Titles, Break Links texts Fonts Size and Article Excerpt (description) text Fonts Size doesn’t change with the change of overall SITE FONT SIZE under Customize section. See live example here: http://webloglab.com/nikon-s7000-review/
On Mobile Screens or Smaller Resolutions, FontAwesome Icons doesn't appear on Main Menu Bar and Top Menu Bar. Whereas this same feature is enabled on Blogger MagOne theme version. See example here: http://pasteboard.co/ct5ppfIEG.png or live example here http://webloglab.com
On Main Menu Bar, When i Add 10 to 12 texts links with FontAwesome Icons on Main Menu, then menu text links shows in two lines instead of single Menu Bar, Menu Bar should compress its size to place all 12 text links in one menu bar line. See example here: http://pasteboard.co/ct8Vr0WGF.png
FontAwesome icons doesnot dispay in Footer section, when we add Custom Menu widgets in Footer section or any kind of Widget Titles with FontAwesome Icons in Footer Area.
Under Customize section (Social Links), There must be an option to include additional Custom Social Media Profile Links or Custom Site Links in Top Right Header.
On Google Search, the site URL is appearing as BreadCrumbs, instead of appearing full length Post URL, this is not good for SEO purpose, there must be an option to select full length URL links appeared on Google Search Results. See example here: http://pasteboard.co/ctgkn8lr5.png
On homepage, main blog title is tag with <H1> heading, which is good. But what not good is, <H2> tags are appeared for sidebar title, and <H3> tags are appearing for article/post title. Which i think is Not Good for SEO. You must replace <h2> with <h3> and <h3> with <h2> on all Index Pages i.e. Home Page, Archive Page, Search Page, Tag Page, Category Page, Static Page etc. to improve blog SEO juice.
